            <h4>Bora Bora</h4>
            <p>The island of Bora Bora is actually a volcanic caldera. This geography has produced a lagoon, well protected from waters by the surrounding motus (islets). The lagoon, and the tropical underwater life, including sharks and rays, provide fantastic opportunities for many forms of water-based recreation, ranging from swimming, through snorkelling and to scuba and other options if you truly want to immerse yourself in this unique environment.</p>
